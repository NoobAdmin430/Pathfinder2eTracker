Pathfinder 2e Initiative Tracker

This runs 100% on your local PC (May run on other devices, but I have not tested). When you place a check mark in the "Turn" part of the row it turns the row grey and the row below it turns green to show you which character has complete their turn and which character is next.
Clicking the "Next Round" button will clear all the checkmarks in "Turn" and increase the "Round:" counter to +1.
Entering the initiative and dex mod of each character, then clicking the "Sort by Init & Dex" button sorts each of the character by Initiative first then dexterity.
Clicking the "New Encounter" button clears all information except for the name, type, and dex mod. Also resets the round counter back to 1.
Clicking "Reset Tracker" gives you a warning that all data is wiped as if you start new.
If a character has a condition of "dead" the row is highlighted red and will be skipped on each new round. So, if the dead character comes up for their turn, the green row will skip the dead character and move to the next character that is not dead.
All information is saved if the browser closes. This is wiped if you clear all browser cache.
